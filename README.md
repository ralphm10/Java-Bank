# Java-Bank

A very simplflified version of [Bank Tech test](https://github.com/ralphm10/bank_tech_test), this is an opportunity to practise TDD in Java.

This version is tested with JUnit and also uses AssertJ assertions in one example. It was built using ItelliJ IDEA. 

### Still to do

I would like to add dates to each transaction and some kind of transaction log, likely in the form of a separate statement class.
